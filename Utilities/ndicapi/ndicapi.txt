This library provides a set of C functions for communicating with
measurement systems (also called tracking systems) from
Northern Digital Inc. via the NDI Combined Application
Programmers' Interface.

This C API is based very closely on the serial communications API
published by Northern Digital Inc.  Its primary purpose is to provide
a straightforward C-language programming interface that is portable
across all common computing platforms.
